# RDFNetworking
### Testing + Networking made Easy.

## About
RDFNetworking is a wrapper of URLSession that deals with JSON and is constructed in a simplistic and easy to implement format, making networking requests a breeze. The framework has been constructed in a generic manner allowing for quick and easy implementation and more advanced implementation for larger scale projects.
RDFNetworking also wraps URLSession and URLSessionDataTask to allow you to run Unit Tests with no network latency, resulting in a framework that is easily testable and quick to implement.
